sis - simple imap server
============================
sis is an IMAP server, following the unix philosophy,
trying to be as small as possible while providing
a reliable service.


Requirements
------------
In order to build sis you need... a computer


Installation
------------
Edit config.mk to match your local setup (sis is installed into
the /usr/local namespace by default).

Afterwards enter the following command to build and install sis (if
necessary as root):

    make clean install


Running sis
-----------
By default, sis runs in daemon mode, if you want to avoid detaching use the -d option
    sis -d


Configuration
-------------
The configuration of sis is done by creating a custom config.h
and (re)compiling the source code.
